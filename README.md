<!-- presenting a local directory that contains all the rules and configuration files and a dataset directory where one can reproduce different versions of the same analysis. Each dataset directory contains the link to the same Snakefile, allowing the same pipeline to be run. When generating a new version, the configuration files are copied and the version-specific file is linked in the directory to be specifically set.

# DAP

Data Analisys Project is a template and a tool to organize you projects. Suited for bioinformatic or data anaysis project in general.

# Installation

Linux and Mac OSX are supported.

Python >= 3 required.

## Install dap with conda

Dap can be installed from Anaconda: https://anaconda.org/molinerislab/dap with the following command

```
conda install -c molinerislab dap
```

we advise to install it in the `base` environment, indeed dap will take care of handling project specific environments.

## Install dap outside conda
Dap can be installed outside of conda using Pip. The disadvantage of this strategy is that dependencies must be installed manually.

### Instal dependencies

**git**

Install `git` on your sistem. A good guide for this is https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

Configure git with the command

```git config --global --edit```

**conda**

Follow the instruction on https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/

**direnv**

You can follow the instruction here: https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html

Alternartiveli you can use conda `conda install -c conda-forge direnv`

**Gitpython**
Run  `pip install gitpython`

### Install Dap with Pip

After installing, direnv needs to be hooked into the shell:
* for bash: add `eval "$(direnv hook bash)"` to your .bashrc file
* for other shells: https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html
 1. Clone this repository `git clone git@github.com:molinerisLab/dap.git dap`
 1. Go to the newly created directory `cd dap`
 1. Run `pip install .`


# Usage
## Help is provided by this command:
`dap --help`

## Create a new project
Go in the directory that host your projects or create a new one, e.g. `cd ~; mkdri prj; cd ~/prj`

The command `dap create` creates a new project in the current working directory; it initiates a git repository and creates a conda environment.


```dap create [--usesnakemake --usemake --usebmake][--source_env=MyEnvironment] ProjectName ProjectVersion```

* ProjectName: the name of the project, which will correspond to the directory and the git repository created.
* ProjectVersion: initial version of the project; the directory dataset/{ProjectVersion} is created. ProjectVersion might specify subfolders to be put inside dataset; i.e. *humans/v1* will create the directory *dataset/humans/v1* and a version named *humans_v1*
* [--usesnakemake --usemake --usebmake]: creates the project with templates for Snakemake, Makefile and BMake. Many templates can be specified at the same time. **If no template is specified, Snakemake is used by default**.
* [--source_env=MyEnvironment]: optionally the user can specify an existing conda environment that is to be cloned when creating the project environment.
 
### Example of directory tree created with Snakemake template:
```
ProjectName
├── dataset
│   ├── V1
│   │   ├── Snakefile (symlink -->)
│   │   ├── config.yaml (symlink -->)
│   │   ├── Snakefile_versioned.sk (symlink -->)
├── local
│   ├── src
│   ├── bin
│   ├── env
│   ├── rules
│   │  ├── Snakefile
│   ├── config
│   │  ├── config_V1.mk
│   │  ├── Snakefile_versioned_V1.sk
│   ├── data
│   ├── modules
```

## Update existing project
`dap update` is to be executed inside the project directory and allows for the creation of new versions or the update of an existing version by adding different templates.
Two different use cases for dap update are:
* You want to add a different template to your project version - i.e. you may have created the project with the Snakefile template but want to add the Make template
* You want to create a new project version with empty version-specific rules.

`dap update [--usesnakemake --usemake --usebmake] ProjectVersion`
* ProjectVersion: version of the project where the operation is to be applied; if the version does not exist, it is created.
* [--usesnakemake --usemake --usebmake]: adds the templates for Snakemake, Makefile and BMake. Many templates can be specified at the same time. **If no template is specified, Snakemake is used by default**.  **If one or more templates already exist, they are not changed**.

**By running dap update, files already existing are never modified**


## Create new version
`dap clone` is to be executed inside the project directory and it creates a new version of the project by cloning an existing one.

`dap clone SourceVersion NewVersion`
* SourceVersion: Name of the version to be cloned.
* NewVersion: Name of the new version.

The command creates a new directory  *PRJ_ROOT/dataset/{NewVersion}*. Here, for each link inside *PRJ_ROOT/dataset{SourceVersion}*:
* If the link refers to a non-version specific file: it copies the link.
* If the link refers to a version specific file: it creates a copy of the file and adds a link to the new one in the version directory.
**By convention, version specific files' names end with _{VersionName}.**

### Dap clone and sub-versions
SourceVersion and NewVersion might refer to subfolders inside the dataset/ directory, using the common '/' syntax. For example it's possible to have a version named *humans/v1*. In this case the following operations are allowed:
* dap clone humans/v1 humans/v2 --> simply clones the humans/v1 version into humans/v2.
* dap clone humans/v1 bald_monkeys/v1 --> clones the humans/v1 version into bald_monkeys/v1. If bald_monkey directory does not exist, it creates it.
* dap clone humans bald_monkeys --> clones the entire humans directory into the new directory. Any version inside the human directory will be cloned.
These operations are not allowed:
* dap clone humans humans/v3 --> cannot clone entire directory into a subdirectory of it.
* dap clone humans/v1 humans --> cannot clone directory into parent (or ancestor) directory.

## dap addmodule
**Currently not available**
It imports an external project inside the current project as a module, cloning it from a remote repository. 
The module is added as an sub-module in git.
### commands
`dap addmodule RepoUrl ProjectVersion ModuleVersion`
* RepoUrl: URL of the remote repository.
* ProjectVersion: path to the directory containing the project's version where you want to import the module, relative to PRJ_ROOT. In most cases it's a path structured as **dataset/{ProjectVersion}**
* ModuleVersion: name of the module's version we want to import.

ProjectVersion and ModuleVersion are optional. If not provided, dap will clone the project inside local/modules without creating version-specific symlinks.

### Compliance of the project
The project to be imported as a module must be compliant with the structure of the projects created with **dap**. It must contain the directory *INNER_PRJ_ROOT/dataset/{ModuleVersion}*.

The command, for each symbolic link inside the directory *INNER_PRJ_ROOT/dataset/{ModuleVersion}* creates a symbolic link in the directory *PRJ_ROOT/{ProjectVersion}/{ModuleName}* pointing to the same file.
